## HealthTech Project - COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker and Medical FAQ

Based on the daily struggles of constantly looking for COVID Vaccine Appointments and wasting a sustantial amount of time, this project aims to cut that time and do that job automatically. The user will just have to enter their information and the system will display the available slots as of right now to the user and will also notify in future when more slots become available gradually.

In addition to that, this project also aims to simplify the process of getting information related to COVID Vaccine and its side effects, if any. A substantial amount of population have faced a side effect or two, and in some cases, the patient really needs some information but they're unable to step outside to go to a doctor. Hence, this project aims to connect People and Doctors in a proper manner. A user can see the FAQ and ask a question if his question isn't listed, and the Doctor will be able to answer those questions, and they will be shown to the existing FAQ section later on.
